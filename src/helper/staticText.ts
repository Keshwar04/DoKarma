    \n When it comes to making financial contributions to NGOs, a donation of any amount makes a massive difference. But a monthly donation provides a steady stream of support that gives people the assurance that their short and long terms are being tended to. Whether it’s long-term ICU care for orphans, rations for elders or tuition fees for out-of-school girls, your monthly donation can give each of these groups of people the guarantee that they are being cared for and supported.`,
  supportingTxt2: `Mission: No Child Orphaned provides orphans with shelter, nutrition, medicines, education and most importantly, a nurturing environment filled with care and affection. Innocent children are often abandoned by their own families because of disabilities, lack of finances, the gender of the child or other reasons. When children are abandoned, they are placed in danger, not only because they don’t have shelter and parental care, but because they are suddenly vulnerable to criminals and traffickers who seek to abuse and exploit them. 
    \n Without constant supervision, children are often mistreated and this is a tragic situation that often takes a lifetime to reverse.`,

    title2: "The Brilliance of Karthigai Deepam",
    title3: "The Message of Karthigai Deepam",
    text1: `India is a country where spirituality and traditions blend harmoniously, giving rise to festivals that inspire deep devotion and thoughtful reflection. Among these, Karthigai Deepam, celebrated with enthusiasm in Tamil Nadu, stands out as a celebration of light, faith, and togetherness. Rooted in ancient customs, it symbolizes the triumph of light over darkness and serves as a reminder to spread kindness, compassion, and hope.`,
    text2: `Karthigai Deepam is observed in the Tamil month of Karthigai (November-December). The festival commences on Pournami (the full moon day) and reaches its peak with the lighting of lamps in homes, temples, and streets. The festival holds special importance in Thiruvannamalai, where the holy Arunachala Hill, revered as a representation of Lord Shiva, becomes the center of devotion.
    \n The pinnacle of the celebration is the Maha Deepam, a massive flame lit atop the Arunachala Hill. This sacred flame represents the eternal light of Lord Shiva and is visible from miles away. Millions of devotees gather in Thiruvannamalai to witness this magnificent event, offering prayers and heartfelt devotion. Simultaneously, households across Tamil Nadu light traditional earthen lamps, symbolizing the shared goal of dispelling ignorance and spreading unity through light.`,
    text3: `While Karthigai Deepam is deeply spiritual, its underlying message transcends religious practices. It emphasizes the importance of nurturing the light within ourselves and sharing it with others. The simple act of lighting a lamp holds a profound meaning—highlighting how even small actions can make a significant difference in dispelling darkness, whether physical or symbolic.
    \n This message serves as a reminder that each individual has the ability to brighten someone else’s life. Whether through acts of kindness, spreading knowledge, or supporting those in need, the festival encourages us to focus on making a positive impact in the world around us.`,

    title1: "Thiruvannamalai and Your Spiritual Connection",
    title2: "Arunachala Hill: A Beacon of Spiritual Energy",
    title3: "A Sacred Town Facing Modern Challenges",
    text1: `Thiruvannamalai, a serene town in Tamil Nadu, holds a special place in the hearts of spiritual seekers and devotees. Renowned for the sacred Arunachala Hill, it is more than a destination; it is a source of divine energy and spiritual awakening. Every year, millions are drawn to this holy town to experience its profound significance and to partake in rituals that connect them with the divine.`,
    text2: `Arunachala Hill is considered a physical manifestation of Lord Shiva in the element of fire. This towering hill is not just a natural wonder but also a deeply revered site, embodying eternal wisdom and enlightenment. Devotees walk the 14-km path around the hill in a practice called Girivalam, an act of devotion that symbolizes surrender and reflection. Walking barefoot along this path is believed to purify the soul, absolve one’s sins, and foster inner harmony.
    \n The grandeur of Thiruvannamalai is further amplified by the Arunachaleswarar Temple, one of the largest and most awe-inspiring temples in India. Known for its towering gopurams (gateway towers) and intricate carvings, the temple is not only a testament to ancient craftsmanship but also a sanctuary for meditation and worship. The temple’s sacred energy draws countless visitors who seek solace, guidance, and connection with the divine.`,
    text3: `Despite its spiritual prominence, Thiruvannamalai grapples with modern-day challenges. The influx of pilgrims and tourists, especially during festivals such as Karthigai Deepam, has a significant impact on the local environment. Waste accumulation, deforestation, and overuse of natural resources are pressing concerns that threaten the delicate balance of this spiritual haven.`,
